if round is finished, don't make player click to reveal if they discard new card
shouldn't be able to reveal an already revealed card...

when it's your turn to flip a card, you can accidentally choose one you've flipped already
need hints for when it's your turn
need animations for cards being flipped/discarded
animation for reshuffle
hint for how many cards left in deck? maybe?

save gameid/playerid to localstorage. allow resume

garbage collect stale games
if a player leaves in lobby, remove them from game
if a player leaves in game, do what? they could still rejoin?
do we need more controls for the host to kick? add mid-game?
